                You don't need an app to use Omegle on your phone or tablet! 
                The web site works great on mobile.
            </h5>
            <p>
                Omegle (oh·meg·ull) is a great way to meet new friends, even while practicing social distancing. 
                When you use Omegle, you are paired randomly with another person to talk one-on-one. If you prefer, 
                you can add your interests and you’ll be randomly paired with someone who selected some of the same 
                interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help you stay safe, chats are anonymous unless you tell someone who you are (not recommended!), 
                and you can stop a chat at any time. See our <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.omegle.com/static/guidelines.html"> Community Guidelines</a> for more 
                info about the do’s and don’ts in using Omegle. Omegle video chat is moderated but no moderation 
                is perfect. Users are solely responsible for their behavior while using Omegle.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>YOU MUST BE 18 OR OLDER TO USE OMEGLE. </b>See Omegle’s <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">Terms of Service</a> for more info. Parental control 
                protections that may assist parents are commercially available and you can find more info at 
               <a href="https://www.connectsafely.org/controls/ ">https://www.connectsafely.org/controls/ </a> as well as other sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please leave Omegle and visit an adult site instead if that's what you're looking for, and you are 18 or older.
